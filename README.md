# Dockerized Slack ArchiveBot

Dockerized version of https://github.com/docmarionum1/slack-archive-bot

## Installation

1. Create an app in your Slack: https://api.slack.com/apps and click "Create new App"
1. Create a "Bot User" for that app: click "Bot Users" in app settings, then "Add a Bot User": username ```archivebot```, Display Name: ```ArchiveBot```
1. Install the app in your Slack Worplace: go to "OAuth & Permissions" and click on "Install App to Workspace"
1. You will need the "Bot User OAuth Access Token" you can see at the "OAuth & Permissions" menu, in the ```<API_TOKEN>``` below (please note: you will see this token only *after* installing the app in your workspace)
1. Clone this repo 

1. Create a directory for historical data

       cd slack-archive-bot-dockerized
       mkdir -p directory-with-initial-export

1. (Skip in case you do not care about importing historical data into your archive)
[Export your team's slack history.](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201658943-Export-your-team-s-Slack-history)
Download the archive and unzip it to a directory called ```directory-with-initial-export``` 

1. Build docker container with 

       docker build --build-arg slack_api_token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -t slack-archive-bot .

1. Create a volume where to store the sqlite database file (```slack.sqlite```)

       docker volume create  slack-archive-bot

1. Run the container 

       docker run  --mount source=slack-archive-bot,target=/app slack-archive-bot


## Docker tips

You can access the volume directly with 

```
docker run -it --rm --mount source=slack-archive-bot,target=/app ubuntu
# then you'll see the slack.sqlite file with
# ls /app/slack.sqlite
```        


## Archiving New Messages

When running, ArchiveBot will continue to archive new messages for any channel it
is invited to.  To add the bot to your channels:

       /invite @ArchiveBot

If @ArchiveBot is the name you gave your bot user.

## Searching

To search the archive, direct message (DM) @ArchiveBot with the search query.
For example, sending the word "pizza" will return the first 10 messages that
contain the word "pizza".  There are a number of parameters that can be provided
to the query.  The full usage is:

        <query> from:<user> in:<channel> sort:asc|desc limit:<number>

        query: The text to search for.
        user: If you want to limit the search to one user, the username.
        channel: If you want to limit the search to one channel, the channel name.
        sort: Either asc if you want to search starting with the oldest messages,
            or desc if you want to start from the newest. Default asc.
        limit: The number of responses to return. Default 10.
